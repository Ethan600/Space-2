<section id="space_shuttles">
<p>NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT SPACE SHUTTLES </p>

<P>THE SPACE SHUTTLE IS A MODULE USED TO LAUNCH ASTRONAUTS AND PAYLOADS LIKE THE HUBBLE TELESCOPE TO THE SPACE.THE SPACE SHUTTLE CONSISTS OF EXTERNAL TANK(ET),ORBITER VEHICLE(OV)AND THE SOLID ROCKET BOOSTERS(SRB).THE LARGE ORANGE TANK IS THE EXTERNAL TANK(ET),THE PLANE LIKE MODULE IS THE ORBITER VEHICLE(OV) AND THE SMALL ROCKETS (ON THE SIDES) ARE THE SOLID ROCKET BOOSTERS(SRB),THE (SRB)s ARE USED TO LIFT THE SPACE SHUTTLE TILL THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE.THE SRBs  ARE REUSABLE.AFTER THE SRBs ARE USED THE SPACE SHUTTLE DEPENDS TOTALY ON THE EXTERNAL TANK(ET).BEFORE LAUNCH THE ET IS FILLLED UP WITH LIQUID HYDROGEN AND LIQUID OXYGEN.AFTER THE ORBITER VEHICLE(OV) REACHES THE EARTH'S ORBIT,THE ET DETACHES FROM THE OV AND BURNS UP IN THE ATMOSPHERE.</P>


<br>


<P>THE ORBITER VEHICLE OR THE OV IS LIKE A PLANE IT WAS USED TO LAUCH ASTRONAUTS AND PAYLOADS LIKE THE HUBBLE TELESCOPE AND THE MODULES OF THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION.</P>

<P>THE UNITED STATES HAD BUILT 5 OF THEM,THEY ARE:- </P>
<P>1.ENTERPRISE</P>
<P>2.ATLANTIS</P>
<P>3.DISCOVERY</P>
<P>4.ENDEAVOUR</P>
<P>5.COLUMBIA</P>
<P>6.CHALLENGER</P>


<IMG SRC ="endeavor.jpg" height="250" width="250">
<P>THE ENTERPRISE WAS THE FIRST EVER SPACE SHUTTLE TO BE BUILT BUT IT NEVER GOT A CHANCE TO GO SPACE,IT REMAINED ON THE EARTH TO DO TESTS. </P>

<br>

<IMG SRC ="FlatRegularHorseshoebat-size_restricted.gif" height="250" width="600">
<P>SPACE SHUTTLE COLUMBIA AND CHALLENGER WERE BOTH DESTROYED IN ACCIDENTS.THE OTHER 4 ORBITERS CAN BE FOUND IN A SMITHSONIAN'S NATIONAL AIR AND SPACE MUSEUM IN THE UNITED STATES.</P>

<br>

<P>WHILE THE AMERICANS WERE BUSY WITH THEIR SHUTTLE PROGRAMME THE SOVIETS LAUNCHED THEIR FIRST EVER SPACE SHUTTLE,IT WAS KNOWN AS BURAN(RUSSIAN: Бура́н),AND YES IT WAS BETTER THAN THE THE AMERICAN SPACE SHUTTLE AND IT COULD LAND ITSELF.</P>
<IMG SRC ="STS1-petit.jpg" height="250" width="250">

<br>  <br>  

<p>THE INDIAN MINI UNMANNED SPACE SHUTTLE RLV-TD,WAS LAUNCHED ON  ITS MAIDEN FLIGHT ON 23 MAY 2016 </p>
